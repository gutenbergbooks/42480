<h2 class="sb">TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.</h2>
<p class="center1">(<em>By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.</em>)</p>
<p class="title1b">I.&mdash;THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS.</p>

<p>The island of Seringapatam is without exaggeration one of the
fairest jewels in the imperial diadem of our world-wide possessions.
Embosomed in the blue and sparkling wavelets of the Pacific Ocean,
breathed upon by the spicy breezes that waft their intoxicating perfumes
through endless groves of gigantic acacias, feathery fern
trees, and gorgeously coloured Indian acanthoids; studded with the
glittering domes of a profusion of jasper palaces beside which the
trumpery splendours of Windsor or Versailles are but as dust, and
guarded by the loyal devotion of an ancient warrior race noted not
less for the supreme beauty of its women than for the matchless
courage and endurance of its men, the Kingdom of Seringapatam
offered during a period of more than one hundred years a stubborn
resistance even to the arms of the all-conquering Britons. So great
indeed, was the respect extorted
from the victors by the vanquished
that when, owing to the marvellous
strategy of my old friend
Major-General Sir <span class="sc">Bonamy Battlehorn</span>,
K.C.B., K.C.M.G., the
island was finally subdued, it was
agreed that in all but their acknowledgment
of a British Suzerainty
and the payment of an
annual tribute of fifteen hundred
gold lakhs, the proud islanders
were to maintain their independence
and to continue those forms
of government which long tradition
had invested in their eyes
with all the sanctity of a religion.</p>

<p>I had been present with my
dear father at the great battle of
the Dead Marshes by which the
fortunes of the islanders were
finally shattered. Never shall I
forget the glow of exultant gratitude
with which towards the end
of the day gallant old Sir <span class="sc">Bonamy</span>
came cantering towards me on his
elephant. "Thank you, thank
you a thousand times, my dear
<span class="sc">Orlando</span>," said the glorious veteran
as he approached me; "it
was that last charge of yours at
the head of your magnificent
Thundershakers that has converted
defeat into victory, and
assured Westminster Abbey to the
bones of <span class="sc">Bonamy Battlehorn</span>.
All that is now necessary," he continued,
rising in his stirrups and waving his sword, "is that you
should complete the work that you have begun. Dost see that
battery of fifty guns still served by the haughty remnants of the
Seringapatamese bombardiers? Let them be captured, and nothing
will stand between us and the Diamond City of the Ranee."</p>

<p>I needed no further incitement. Gathering round me the few
Thundershakers who had escaped unscathed, I bade the standard-bearer
unfurl the flag of the brigade. In another moment we were
upon them. Cutting, slashing, piercing, parrying, trampling,
crushing, we dashed into the midst of the foe. Far over the field of
carnage sounded our war-cry, the famous "Higher up Bayswater!"
which was to our horses as the prick of spur. In vain the doughty
bombardiers belaboured us; in vain did they answer with the awful
shout of "Benkcitibenk," which none hitherto had been able to
withstand. The work was hot, but in less than three minutes the
battery was ours, and the broken host of the Ranee was streaming
in full flight down the slopes from which so lately they had dealt
death amongst the English army. In another moment we had
limbered up&mdash;two men to each gun, except the largest, which was
assigned to me as the chief of the band&mdash;and helter skelter down the
hill we went, and so, with shouting and with laughter, deposited
our spoils at the feet of the British General.</p>

<p>I do not recount this incident in order to magnify my own exploits.
My deeds themselves are my best record, those deeds which a
factious majority in successive Parliaments has, to its everlasting
shame, refused to recognise, but which not even the voice of
malice, always busy in the task of depreciating genuine achievement,
can rob of one particle of their brilliant and immortal lustre.
But the fight is indissolubly connected with the stirring story which
I have here set out to relate, and for this reason alone have I
mentioned it. During the brief struggle round the guns I became
momentarily separated from the main body of my men. Seizing
the opportunity, and noticing, too, that in the previous <em>mel√©e</em> I had
been unhorsed, two gigantic artillerymen made at me. My sword
was broken, my revolver was empty! What was I to do? But
little time for reflection was left to me. With savage shouts the two
dusky Titans sprang upon me. I gave myself up for lost, shut my
eyes, thought of my poor mother, saw in a flash my happy country
home, the thatched roofs of the cottages, the grey old church, the
babbling stream, the village school, the little shop where my infant
mouth had first become acquainted with the succulent bull's-eye&mdash;in
short, I went through all the symptoms that are understood to
accompany the imminence of a violent death. Suddenly, however,
the desire to live awoke once more. The smaller of my two foes had
outstripped his companion. He was just about to seize me, when,
lowering my head, which was encased in a spiked helmet, I bounded
at him. Fair and full I caught him, and so terrific was the force
engendered by my spring and the foeman's rush, that not the spike
alone, but the helmet and the head too, pierced him through and
through.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a href="images/025-1000.png"><img src="images/025-450.png" width="450" height="493" alt="'Fair and full I caught him.'" /></a>
<h4>"Fair and full I caught him."</h4></div>

<p>Down on his back he fell crashing,
bearing me with him as he
went over and fixing the spike
firmly in the earth, pinned like
some huge beetle by a human pin.
As my legs flew up they encountered
the second giant, and,
winding round his chest, crushed
every vestige of life out of him
and flung his mangled body full
twenty yards to the rear. I had
escaped, but my position was still
uncomfortably awkward. By this
time, however, the rout was complete,
and four of my men, by
dint of tremendous exertions, succeeded
in extricating me from my
curious entanglement. My pinned
foeman turned out to be the
Ranee's brother, <span class="sc">Hadju Thar
Meebhoy</span>. We bore him back
with us to camp, where, marvellous
to relate, after a prolonged
illness, he eventually recovered.</p>

<p>Of course he has never been
quite the same man since. He
has to be careful about his diet,
but with the childlike simplicity
of an Oriental he finds a constant
pleasure in opening and shutting
the little aluminium doors which
our dear old surgeon, <span class="sc">Toby
O'Grady</span>, constructed to replace
the <span class="sc">Khan</span>'s stomach and the
small of his back. I came to be
great friends with him and it
was through him that I gained the knowledge which prompted the
adventure I am now about to relate.</p>

<h2>A WORD ABOUT THE ST. HENRY JAMES'S THEATRE.</h2>

<p>There is something in a name, especially when it happens to be
the title of a play. At the St. James's, Mr. <span class="sc">Alexander's</span> latest
venture has been <em>Guy Domville</em>, by the American novelist <span class="sc">Henry
James</span>, who if he knew as much about play-writing as he does about
novel-writing would probably be in the first flight of dramatists;
<em>and</em> he would not have chosen so hopeless a name for his hero and for
his play as <em>Guy Domville</em>. For the anti-James jokers would delight
in finding that <em>Guy could</em> be "<em>guy'd</em>," and to say as to
"<em>Domville</em>"
that "a first night audience '<em>vill dom</em>' the play." For all that, if
<span class="sc">Alexander</span> be the sagacious commander in the dramatic field that he
has hitherto shown himself, it is not likely that he should have been
completely mistaken in accepting a play which a portion of the public
has refused to accept. Of course, a manager cannot afford to keep a
play going until the public come <em>en masse</em> to see it, and therefore,
unless there is "a turn of the tide" (and such things have happened
before now, and a condemned piece has had a long and prosperous
career), Mr. <span class="sc">Alexander</span> will himself be obliged to do to the play what
those who ridicule and chaff it have already done, <em>i.e.</em> "<em>take it
off</em>."</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p class="ind1"><span class="sc">Mrs. R.</span> admits that she has always been very fond of sweets at
dinner. What she is especially fond of is, she says, "a dish of
<em>pommes d'Ananias</em>;" and she always adds, "But, my dear, why
the French choose such awful names for such nice things is what I
never can understand."</p>

<h2>THAT PRECIOUS DONKEY!</h2>

<p class="center1">(<em>An Episode in the Life of A. Briefless, Junior, Esq., Barrister-at-Law, in Three Parts.</em>)</p>

<p class="title1b"><span class="sc">Part II.</span>&mdash;<em>The Passing of the Picture.</em></p>

<p>It may be remembered that the gift of my grateful if eccentric
client had been put in the box-room at Justinian Gardens. There
the presentment of the donkey languidly watching jaded villagers
reposed, amidst the possibly congenial surroundings of broken
perambulators, superannuated folding-doors, and half-forgotten
wide-awake hats. I rather regretted the fate of the picture, as it
seemed to me that it might have served as a not invaluable advertisement.
As a large proportion of the forensic world knows, I not
infrequently during the Yuletide season entertain some of my friends
at the Bar, and I should have been pleased to have been able to point
to the canvas as a sort of testimonial. However, the painting had
disappeared, and there was nothing more to be said about it.</p>

<p>I am reminded by this reference to my vacation entertainments,
that it was at one of "these feasts of reason and flows of soul" (as
my learned and distinguished friend <span class="sc">Appleblossom</span>, Q.C., is kind
enough to call them) that my fortunes underwent a change for the
better. The inhabitants of Justinian Gardens are accustomed to do
things very well. When there is a ball, the number of vehicles
(always with one horse apiece, and sometimes with a pair) is quite
considerable. On such occasions a stranger might imagine that the
Gardens had the advantage of a chronic cab-stand. At 97 (which
I think I may describe as our show-house) there is a butler, and
there are few at Justinian Gardens who cannot boast of a "buttons."
I do not secure the services of a man-retainer myself, and am consequently
not quite in the fashion. However, when I entertain, I
do my best to be worthy of the <em>prestige</em> of my neighbours, and put
forth all my strength in making my house an object of interest.
The walls of my modest dwelling-place are adorned with several
mementoes of my not-altogether-common-place career. For
instance, I have had my commission as a Lieutenant of Volunteers
(I served for many years in the Bishop's Own, and was graciously
permitted by Her Majesty to retire with my rank) glazed and
framed, and have treated the pasteboard distinctions I won at
school in a similar fashion. When I purpose entertaining my
friends at the Bar, I have these gratifying landmarks in my
life's history polished up by an individual known in my household
as "the handy man." This person (towards whom I entertain
a friendly regard), for a certain sum an hour undertakes to
do anything I require. I believe that he can paint a house,
build a conservatory, cut down a forest, and reconstruct an
aquarium with equal facility. But it is only right to say that
I make this statement on the faith of his guarantor&mdash;the gentleman
who was good enough to procure for me the advantage of
his services&mdash;and cannot speak from personal knowledge. So
far I have only had the opportunity of testing his capabilities
in window-cleaning and the dusting of works of art. In performing
these domestic duties he shows great energy, and even
daring. He seems to delight in standing on window-ledges
and the outer edges of flights of stairs. I have been given to
understand that he glories in these displays of hardihood, as
they remind him of the days and nights when he acted as a
rather prominent member of the Fire Brigade.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="sc">Wilkins</span>," I said, on my departure for the Temple,
"I shall esteem it a favour if you will be so good as to
employ your leisure to-day in repainting the waterbutts, sweeping
the kitchen chimney, putting glass in the conservatory,
regilding the mirror in the study, and, if you have time, dusting
my testimonial."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sir," replied my valued acquaintance, and before
I had closed the hall door, the sounds of the rumbling sticks
told me that he had already commenced to remove the superfluous
soot from the culinary smoke-hole.</p>

<p>I had rather an arduous day at Pump-Handle Court. I had
quite an accumulation of circulars, and a consent brief that
required very careful attention. The latter was not endorsed
with my name, but I saw to it on behalf of a colleague. After
I had spent some hours in the little frequented (during the
vacation) realms of the Temple, I returned to Justinian Gardens,
which I need scarcely tell an experienced cabman is in the
neighbourhood of that continually rising locality&mdash;Earl's Court.
The door was opened by Mr. <span class="sc">Wilkins</span> in person, who anticipated
the turning of the proprietorial latch-key.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, Sir," said my trusted <em>employ√©</em>, "that I
have had an accident. While I was dusting the military enlistment
card&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean my commission?"</p>

<p>"I do, Sir. It came down with a run. You see, Sir, you
have had him rather heavily framed. Unfortunately, Sir,
when I passed the polish brush over him the nail did not hold,
and it gave suddenly. The picture made a nasty mark on the
wall, and smashed up when he got to the flooring. I would have
reframed him, but all the shops close early on a Thursday, and I can
get no glass."</p>

<p>"Well, what have you done?" I asked, in a tone of some annoyance,
for I pride myself on my commission, and am proud of showing
it to my friends.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir, I went up to the box-room to see if I could find anything
that would do, and have looked up an affair that I think will
meet with your approval."</p>

<p>By this time I had reached the place where the wall was damaged.
The spot was covered by a picture.</p>

<p>"I did my best, Sir. I washed the canvas with soap and water,
and put the polishing brush over the frame. Of course the subject
ain't worth much, but for a stop-gap it isn't bad. Now is it?"</p>

<p>I then found that Mr. <span class="sc">Wilkins</span> had hidden the faulty hall paper
with the picture that had been presented to me by the gentleman
who had raised a claim to the throne of the Celestial Empire.
Secretly pleased that I could now have an opportunity of referring
to the gratitude of my client to my learned and distinguished friend,
<span class="sc">Appleblossom</span>, Q.C., who had promised to dine with me that evening,
I readily accepted the apologies of the penitent <span class="sc">Wilkins</span>.</p>

<p>"I will put it allright to-morrow, Sir," said my distressed
<em>employ√©</em>. "I will get some glass, fix up your enlistment card, and
have it done before I rebuild the pantry and whitewash the ceiling
of the bath-room."</p>

<p>Satisfied with the promise I thought no more of the <em>contretemps</em>
until after dinner, when my attention was directed to it by
<span class="sc">Appleblossom</span>,
Q.C., who had made himself vastly agreeable after the
ladies had retired and left us to discuss the chestnuts and the port.</p>

<p>"Hullo, <span class="sc">Briefless</span>," he exclaimed; "where did you get that Old
<span class="sc">Boots</span>?"</p>

<p>I told my story of the grateful client, and young <span class="sc">Bands</span>, who I
fancy is thinking of reading in my chambers, regarded me (I venture
to believe) with increased respect.</p>

<p>"Bless me, you have a treasure!" continued <span class="sc">Appleblossom</span>, Q.C.,
who seemed wrapt in admiration. "That is a genuine Old <span class="sc">Boots</span>.
You can always tell him from Young <span class="sc">Boots</span> by the manipulation of
his animal's ears. Look at those, Sir! Splendid! Why, who could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
paint a donkey like that? By Jove, <span class="sc">Briefless</span>, you are in luck!
You ought to make a fortune out of it at <span class="sc">Christies</span>!"</p>

<p>"Why, is it very valuable?" I asked. "I am not much of an
art connoisseur, and I frankly confess I know very little of Old
<span class="sc">Shoes</span>."</p>

<p>"Old <span class="sc">Boots</span>, Sir!" cried <span class="sc">Appleblossom</span>, Q.C. "Why I thought
all the world knew Old <span class="sc">Boots</span>! One of the grandest painters of the
eighteenth century! He got that particular delicacy of touch which
you can trace in that donkey's ears by never commencing to paint
his animals until he was recovering from <em>delirium tremens</em>. Why,
Sir, that animal is simply superb. Look at his mane, Sir! Why, it
is simply marvellous!"</p>

<p>I did look at the donkey's ears and mane, and, with the assistance
of young <span class="sc">Bands</span>, went into an ecstasy. The ears of the animal were
certainly magnificent.</p>

<p>I must admit I was excited during the rest of that eventful evening.
I determined to keep the secret of my good fortune to myself.
I thought I would surprise the lady who does me the honour to bear
my name, by telling her that I had become a rich man after I had
cashed the cheque I was sure to receive. All the following day I
made plans for the spending of my fortune. I would have a box in
the Highlands, a <em>pied-√†-terre</em> in Paris, and a pyramid in Egypt. I
would present my Inn with a massive gold snuff-box, and <span class="sc">Portington</span>
should have a silver-mounted meerschaum. If my age did
not bar my progress, I would seek service in the Militia&mdash;as a
lieutenant-colonel.
There was no limit to my ambition.</p>

<p>When I returned, Mr. <span class="sc">Wilkins</span> (who is thoroughly conscientious),
having finished the rebuilding of the pantry and the whitewashing
of the bath-room, had departed. He does not waste his time, and
only charges me for the hours he actually expends in honest labour.
I hurried to the spot where my Old <span class="sc">Boots</span> was temporarily resting
before removal to the far-famed auction-rooms in King Street,
St. James's. I turned pale.</p>

<p>"Why, what is this?" I asked, trembling with emotion.</p>

<p>"Your commission, dear," said my better seven-eighths. "It
looks better than the picture, although I must say the donkey improves
on acquaintance. It really was very well painted. I am
quite sorry Mr. <span class="sc">Wilkins</span> has taken it away."</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Wilkins</span> taken it away?" I gasped out.</p>

<p>"Yes. He said that you didn't seem to care for it, so he went off
to try and sell it."</p>

<p>"Why!" I exclaimed, and my voice, through my deep emotion,
dropped almost to a whisper, "it is an Old <span class="sc">Boots</span>!"</p>

<p>"An Old <span class="sc">Boots</span>!" cried my better seven-eighths, becoming as
excited as myself. "Why, our fortunes are made! An Old <span class="sc">Boots</span>!
Oh, why didn't you tell me! An Old <span class="sc">Boots</span>! Fancy having an
Old <span class="sc">Boots</span>!"</p>

<p>"But we haven't," I returned, almost in tears. "The handy-man
has gone off with it! What <em>are</em> we to do without our Old <span class="sc">Boots</span>!"</p>

<p>"We will get it back!" returned my better and more important
fraction, with determination.</p>

<p>Whether we did recover our lost treasure, or fail in the attempt,
must, owing to the exigencies of space (so I am given to understand),
form the subject of another and concluding contribution. The chase
after our Old <span class="sc">Boots</span> was not without adventures of a distinctly
exciting character.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy how in recent years, in the matter of fiction, the
star of Empire shineth in the North. After <span class="sc">Walter Scott</span> established
the sovereignty of Scotland in
the world of British fiction, there
was a long pause. In our generation
<span class="sc">William Black</span> came to the front.
Later, we have had <span class="sc">Stevenson</span>,
<span class="sc">Barrie</span>, and <span class="sc">Crockett</span>. Now here is
<span class="sc">Ian Maclaren</span> with his cluster of
gem-like stories gathered <em>Beside the
Bonnie Briar Bush</em> (<span class="sc">Hodder And
Stoughton</span>). My Baronite tells me
that of the collection Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>
likes best "A Doctor of the Old
School." Where all is good it is difficult
to establish supremacy. But for
simple pathos and for the skill of
drawing with a few touches living
figures of flesh and blood, this sketch
is certainly hard to beat. Yet "A
Lad of Pairts" runs it close. A very beautiful book, full of human
nature in its simplest form and most pathetic circumstances.</p>

<p>Says the Baron, "What I who have read Mr. <span class="sc">Bram Stoker's</span> latest
romance could tell you about <em>The Watter's Mou'</em> would make your
mou' watter with longing desire to devour it. It is excellent: first
because it is short; secondly, because the excitement is kept up from
first page to last; and thirdly, because it is admirably written
throughout; the scenic descriptive portion being as entrancing as the
dramatic. It is brought out in the Acme Series in charge of <span class="sc">A
Constable</span>, and its full price is only one shilling."</p>

<p>A good short story is to be found in <em>A Clear Case of the Supernatural</em>,
by <span class="sc">Reginald Lucas</span>, only as it is by no means "a clear
case," it might have been appropriately entitled, <em>Fluke or Spook</em>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Most Appropriate.</span>&mdash;"Gunner <span class="sc">J. C. Rockett</span> promoted to rank

send up a Rockett. Only got to present him with a house at
Gunnersbury and the thing is complete.</p>

<h2>THAT WEDDING PRESENT.</h2>

<p><em>London.</em>&mdash;<span class="sc">Jones</span> is going to be married. Of course, I must give
him something. But what? A biscuit box? Commonplace. Good
idea to look for something more interesting and unusual during my
holiday. Just off to North Italy. Will keep my eyes open along the way.</p>

<p><em>Paris.</em>&mdash;Walk in the Rue de la Paix and Boulevards. Everything
labelled "<em>Article Anglais</em>." Must really get him something made
abroad. Give up looking in Paris. Shall find something farther on.</p>

<p><em>Lucerne.</em>&mdash;No good to take Swiss wood carving. Can't carry home
a huge sideboard. All the smaller things can be bought in London.</p>

<p><em>Milan.</em>&mdash;The very place. There is an exhibition here. Shall probably
see something beautiful. Italy, cradle of the arts, and all that
sort of thing. Besides, so nice to say to <span class="sc">Jones</span>, "My dear fellow,
here's a little trifle; got it in Milan, you know. It's modern, but
then the Italians are always so artistic." To exhibition. Why,
there are pictures here! Of course, just suit me. Hurry to picture
gallery. Several rooms. Enter eagerly. After a short time, totter
feebly out and ask the official at the door where I can obtain a little
brandy. He, evidently alarmed by my horror-stricken face and
staggering movements, asks civilly if I am ill. Would I like a
chair? Should he fetch a doctor? Thank him, and say it is nothing
serious. I have only been looking at a few modern Italian pictures.
Crawl to the refreshment bar, and am revived with cognac. Then
inspect the rest of the exhibition. Am the only visitor, which is not
surprising, for there is nothing to see but bottles! An exhibition of
bottles! They are said to be full of wine, but I do not see how that
makes them more beautiful. Absurd to buy <span class="sc">Jones</span> some bottles.
And equally absurd to buy him some Italian wine when he can get
good French wine in England. Besides, can't carry bottles in my
Gladstone bag. Therefore, give up Milan.</p>

<p><em>Venice.</em>&mdash;The chief manufactures here are lace and glass. Now
<span class="sc">Jones</span> never wears any lace, except in his boots, and never wears any
glass, not even in his eye. So what good would these be to him?
See one or two palaces to be sold. But can't take them home. So
give up Venice.</p>

<p><em>Bologna.</em>&mdash;More useless local productions! Here they make sausages
and soap. <span class="sc">Jones</span> is not a starving scarecrow for want of
sausages, nor a <span class="sc">Simeon Stylites</span> for want of soap. Must therefore
give up Bologna. This wedding present begins to weigh me down.
At each new place it obtrudes itself between me an all the beautiful
things I look at. Must really get something in Florence.</p>

<p><em>Florence.</em>&mdash;Great Scott! It's worse here. A life-size marble
statue, or a mosaic table weighing nearly a ton. Have serious
thoughts of buying, at a great reduction, an extra large statue,
hitherto unsaleable on account of its size, and then telling <span class="sc">Jones</span>
that his wedding present is waiting for him here, if he will come
and fetch it. The dealer asks 2,000 lire. I understand shopping in
Italy. Early one morning offer him 50. He at once comes down to
1,000. I go up to 100. Discuss for one hour, haggle for another
hour, dispute angrily for a third. Then go off to <em>d√©jeuner</em>. Closing
prices&mdash;dealer 725, myself 250. Back again after interval for
refreshment. Begin quietly. Opening prices&mdash;dealer 720, myself
251. Discussion, haggling, dispute as before. Indignant marchings
out by me, frantic pursuits by the dealer. Final prices&mdash;dealer
403, myself 396. Each of us, hoarse and exhausted, refuses to yield
another centesimo. So do not buy statue for <span class="sc">Jones</span>, and give up
Florence. Genoa is the last chance.</p>

<p><em>Genoa.</em>&mdash;Velvet? What's the good of velvet to <span class="sc">Jones</span>? Besides
it is fabulously dear, something like attar of roses at so much a drop.
Must give up even Genoa.</p>

<p><em>London.</em>&mdash;Back again. Have bought a biscuit box and sent it to
<span class="sc">Jones</span>. Since then have met <span class="sc">Jones's</span> cousin, and <span class="sc">Smith</span>,
and <span class="sc">Jones's</span>
brother-in-law, and Mrs. <span class="sc">Robinson</span>, and a few other mutual friends.
We disagree in many things, but in one we seem to be unanimous.
We have all given him biscuit boxes!</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.</h2>

<p class="title1">X.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Chair.</span></p>

<p>As soon as we had agreed to allow the
Parish Meeting Chairman to preside, <span class="sc">Black
Bob</span> jumped up and proposed that Mrs.
<span class="sc">Letham Havitt</span> should be elected to the
chair. She was a lady whose excellences he
need not dilate on. She had excellent business
habits, and, with all respect to Mrs.
<span class="sc">March</span>, she had as much right to a seat on the
Council as that lady. Then a miracle happened.
Mrs. <span class="sc">March</span> not only did not resent
this reference, but actually seconded Mrs.
<span class="sc">Havitt</span>. It was essential, she said, that
women should be represented as fully as possible,
and she should, without hesitation,
embrace this opportunity of securing a woman
colleague. This made the situation serious,
not to say hopeless. After she had sat down,
there was an ominous pause. At length I rose
and proposed myself. In impressive tones I
pointed put that the hand of the electors had
pointed in no uncertain way to myself, and
that since no one else had proposed my
election, at the risk of being misunderstood
<em>once more</em>, I had, on public grounds, to do it
myself. After another painful pause the
Parson seconded my nomination. Then the
voting. Mrs. <span class="sc">Havitt's</span> name was put first.
She got 4 votes&mdash;Mrs. <span class="sc">March</span>, <span class="sc">Black Bob</span>,
and his two comrades. I got 3&mdash;the Squire,
the Parson, and my self. And so I was foiled
again&mdash;by the Eternal Feminine.</p>

<p>And so our Parish Council is at last complete,
and ready for action, a corporate body
in the eyes of the law. Possibly, in these
pages I may from time to time be permitted
to relate how Mudford progresses under our
rule. Possibly, I may not. But in any case
I ought to add that, being beaten by Mrs.
<span class="sc">Havitt</span> has not&mdash;well, improved the domestic
atmosphere. Wifely devotion seems to be
out of fashion in these <em>fin de si√®cle</em> days.</p>

<h3>DUTCH ENTERPRISE.</h3>

<p class="ind">The question of alien immigration as affecting
the British Labour Market is one that

<h2>A CABINET SECRET.</h2>

<p class="center1">(<em>Fragment for the Historian of the Future.</em>)</p>

<p class="ind1">
[After the Cabinet several of the Ministers present took luncheon with
the <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>.&mdash;<em>Daily Paper.</em>]
</p>

<p>There had been an exciting meeting of the Members of the
Ministry. The gathering had taken place at noon, and after several
angry altercations it had been adjourned. But the objector-in-chief
had admirably kept his temper. He came of a gallant and illustrious
race, and blood is thicker than water.</p>

<p>"I must not forget the teachings of my Uncle <span class="sc">Dick</span>," he had
murmured, as it was suggested that two of his favourite projects
should be slaughtered, like the infant Princes in the Tower.</p>

<p>Then, when there was an inclination on the part of his colleagues
to quarrel amongst themselves, he cleverly fanned the
fire, and increased the incipient strife.</p>

<p>"It was the mode adopted by my maiden Aunt, <span class="sc">Queen
Elizabeth</span>, and it succeeded in her time. Why should
the passing of three or four centuries make any difference?
After all, human nature is&mdash;in fact&mdash;human
nature!"</p>

<p>And so the dull minutes passed away. The time came
for luncheon. Then he smiled a smile full of mystic
hospitality.</p>

<p>"It will put the bloodhounds of the Press off the scent
if I ask them to luncheon with me. It is sure to be
reported in the papers, and who will imagine that I
would willingly entertain a possible opponent to the
coming Budget? Moreover, revenge is sweet; not that
I would take it! not that I would take it!"</p>

<p>And then he entreated several of his colleagues to
"crush a cup with him," using a phraseology that had
found favour in the mouths of the Crusaders.</p>

<p>"And <span class="sc">Rosey</span>, will not you come?" The question was asked with
much cordiality. The <span class="sc">Premier</span> did not reply. He merely smiled,
and the smile seemed to be a sufficient answer.</p>

<p class="center"> *
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *
</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards (as subsequently reported in the newspapers)
the noble Earl took luncheon at his own home.</p>

<p>"I wonder what wine he has given <em>them?</em>" And he smiled again.</p>

<h3>"BOYS AND GIRLS COME OUT TO&mdash;&mdash;PANTOMIME!"</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/035b-340.png"><img src="images/035b-150.png" width="150" height="246" alt="Pantomime" /></a></div>

<p><em>Santa Claus</em>, the afternoon pantomime at the Lyceum, is even better
than Mr. <span class="sc">Oscar Barrett's</span> <em>Cinderella</em> of last year. There is
plenty of
splendour in the fairy piece, considered merely as a "spectacle,"
enough, indeed, to make a "pair of spectacles," and to cause much
speculation as to how they manage to stow away all the scenery,
properties, and costumes at five o'clock every afternoon, in order to
make room for <em>King Arthur</em>, who, on the temporary abdication of
<em>Santa Claus</em> (a part admirably acted and declaimed by Mr. <span class="sc">William
Rignold</span>), reigns at the Lyceum from eight till eleven. But besides
the dazzling brilliancy of fairy pantomime, there is in it not only real
fun which delights the youngsters, for whom the entertainment is
primarily intended, but also a touch of dramatic pathos, as shown in
the death of the devoted dog <em>Tatters</em>, a dog who has his
day and dies, whose cruel fate excites the compassion of
old and young alike. All are rejoiced when they find out
that clever Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Lauri</span>, of whom it can be
complimentarily said that "he is a perfect beast," is restored
to life, and that the Heavenly Twins are happily
revived.</p>

<p>As the two toy soldiers Messrs. <span class="sc">Harry</span> and <span class="sc">Fred
Kitchen</span>&mdash;the front and back kitchen&mdash;are first-rate.
But where all are so good it is impossible, within the
limits of a paragraph, to particularise. Messrs <span class="sc">Barrett</span>
and <span class="sc">Lennard</span> are to be congratulated, and, as <em>Hamlet</em>
says, "The Pantomime's the thing," and, as Shakspearian
readers will remember, <em>Hamlet's</em> father went to
<em>matin√©es</em>,&mdash;wasn't it "his custom always of an afternoon"?&mdash;only
there's no sleeping here, but everyone
very wide awake, and all "going home to tea"
thoroughly satisfied with <em>Santa Claus</em>. Who says <em>Le
Roi Pantomime est mort</em>, when the Lyceum is crowded for
<em>matin√©es</em>, and, outside the doors of Old Drury, daily and
nightly appear the placards, "House Full"?</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p class="ind1"><span class="sc">A "Tit Bit."</span>&mdash;When they speak of some one of the Baby
Baronets, <em>i.e.</em> the recently created Baronets, they don't say he is
among the Old'uns; but "He is among the New'nes."</p>

not? A dramatist has only

<p class="ind"><em>A Casual Visitor.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;Then we
have only to regard the Adelphi

Wyldest license with the
dialogue.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Charles his Friend.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;Quite
so. After all, a paradox is
merely a platitude.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>A Caller.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;But do great men
do these things?</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Charles his Friend.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;The
great do all things because
they are little.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>A Lady.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;Surely a wife
should look up to her husband?</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Charles his Friend.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;So she
does&mdash;unless she wears high
heels.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>A Person.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;And a wife, if
she found her husband in
trouble, would surely cleave to
him?</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Charles his Friend.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;So she
would, if she only knew where
to find him.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Another Person.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;That reminds
me that a play, to be
successful, must have the plot
of a shilling shocker&mdash;much
diluted.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Charles his Friend.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;A
shocker shocks no one save its&mdash;publisher.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>A New Comer.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;Then the
blackmailer was defeated in
the end&mdash;as bad people invariably
are when vice is at a discount
and virtue at a premium.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Charles his Friend.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;Virtue
never is at a premium, save
when it is mistaken for
vice.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>A blas√© Man of the World.</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, in spite of all this, I
have had a pleasant evening.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Charles his Friend.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;So has
an author when he is laughing
in his sleeve and confuses
black with white.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Someone.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;But does the
author never know the difference?</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Charles his Friend.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;What
does it matter? If he thinks
himself right, everybody will
know that he is wrong!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The Audience.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;All this is
very clever because it is unintelligible.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The Author.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;So I believe.
Only I stand upon my irresponsibility.
But is anyone
